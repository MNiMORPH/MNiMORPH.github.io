## Research interests

I investigate ice, water, and landscapes through the past and present. My tools are physics, computers, sensors, experiments, and geological field observations. I am passionate about unifying theory and observations in Earth-surface dynamics, deciphering the glacial history of North America and using its ice-sheet-altered rivers as natural experiments about Earth-surface processes, and open-source software and hardware. My research often takes me to Argentina; Germany; the upper Mississippi River valley; and my desk with my pen, paper, and a comfortable mug of tea.
