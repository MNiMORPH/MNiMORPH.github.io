## Current Research

1. Basin integration, transverse drainage development, and the establishment of through-flowing rivers. Basin-scale adjustment and geomorphology post-drainage integration.  For example, Salt and Verde Rivers, Basin and Range, Arizona, USA. Post-glacial landscapes of the upper Midwest, USA.
2. Post-glacial drainage basin/landscape evolution of the upper Mississippi River basin due to base level fluctuations: Chippewa (Wisconsin), Cannon (Minnesota), Whitewater (Minnesota), Zumbro (Minnesota), Minnesota (Minnesota) River drainage basins. This includes anthropogenic influence on these systems (e.g. climate change, land-use).
3. Geomorphology and paleoenvironmental significance of late Pleistocene and Holocene aeolian deposition in the upper Mississippi River basin (western Wisconsin, eastern Minnesota) as an analogue landscape for modern regions experiencing deglaciation and permafrost melt-out.
4. Piedmont landform (pediments, alluvial fans, talus flat irons) and hillslope evolution in the southwestern USA (Arizona, California, Utah).
5. Sandur geomorphology and evolution, Iceland. Fluvial geomorphology in Iceland.
6. Bedrock river incision and knickpoint retreat due to base level fluctuations: North shore of Lake Superior
7. Origin and evolution of entrenched and incised meanders.
