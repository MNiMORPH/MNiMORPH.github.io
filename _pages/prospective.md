# The lab & our group

<img align="right" src="/assets/images/DSC_0728_OnABoat.JPG" alt="Group members and friends on the ferry to Perito Moreno Glacier" width="480px">

We are a group that straddles traditional disciplines. We are based out of the historic [**Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory**](https://www.safl.umn.edu/) [(Google Maps)](https://goo.gl/maps/Fn7Hxyugo2LJnnkq9), built into the side of the largest waterfall on the Mississippi, where we interact wtih fluid dynamicists from across science and engineering. We also run and maintain the **Surface Processes Instrumentation Lab** within the [Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences](https://www.esci.umn.edu/) in [John T. Tate Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/uv?hl=en&pb=!1s0x52b32d1661d0911f%3A0xb4bf99a8068a596f!3m1!7e115!4shttps%3A%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipNT5CBaqaF5K2RSo63dayZLeght6UBqYgTeFtJ2%3Dw262-h176-k-no!5sjohn%20t%20tate%20hall%20-%20Google%20Search!15sCgIgAQ&imagekey=!1e10!2sAF1QipNT5CBaqaF5K2RSo63dayZLeght6UBqYgTeFtJ2&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiy2uDSk4brAhXbVc0KHRAnDbAQoiowFHoECBAQBg); this department is Wickert's tenure home and also the entity that grants students' degrees. Wickert is also an Associate of the [**Institute on the Environment (IonE)**](http://environment.umn.edu/), which hosts educational and research programs and helps us to communicate our work and to produce impactful applications. In addition, group members have access to and are collaborators with Minnesota State, Mankato's Earth Science and Geography Programs, as well as with the EARTH System Laboratory - a student focused Quaternary science, archeology, and geomorphology/surface process laboratory in Mankato, MN.  The other group faculty, Dr. Phillip Larson, founded the EARTH Systems Lab and is the Director of Earth Science Programs at Minnesota State, Mankato.  Wickert is also graduate faculty at Minnesota State, Mankato, allowing for Mankato Geography and Earth Science students to be part of this research group. Larson is graduate faculty in Earth and Environmental Sciences at the University of Minnesota and can work with UMN graduate students as well.

Most importantly, though, we are the lab members. If you are inquisitive, open-minded, interested in connecting theory and observations, and someone who wants to be a member of a diverse and collaborative team, you could be a good fit. If you are excited about instrumentation design, numerical methods, physical computing, laboratory experiments, geomorphic history, field investigations, sea level, and/or the development of theory, your interests intersect with ours. We have limited positions, but we're always glad to hear form interested applicants.

## What is a UROP, MS, PhD, or Postdoc all about?

There are multiple ways to become involved in the lab group. Below is an overview of the goals for each type of experience and position within the group, as well as a brief description of the position itself.

* At the completion of an **undergraduate research** position (UROP or REU), a student will have gained knowledge in an area of research as well as insights into how the lab and group operate. These positions start with basic skills and then grow, and undergraduate researchers who work with us throughout much of their time at the university end up operating more like MS students and can contribute to or lead research studies.
* A **MS** in geoscience indicates that a student has the skills and capacity to bring a complex scientific project to completion.
  * A MS program is typically 2 years.
  * You will receive guidance from your advisor and/or other research group members.
  * You will typically join a project whose focus is already tightly defined.
* A **PhD** in geoscience indicates that a student has built a substantial body of work that adds to the collective knowledge about the Earth system, and in the process has acquired the skills to become a successful independent scientist.
  * A PhD program is typically 4-6 years.
  * You will receive guidance from group members, but advance towards independence through time, and ideally graduate as a colleague and collaborator of the research team.
  * You may or may not join a predefined project, but are expected either way to take the lead in shaping your role and work.
* A postdoctoral research scientist ("**postdoc**") uses their time with the research group to advance their studies and make new scientific discoveries. They may help to advise students, run the lab, and take early steps towards building independent research directions and programs. Upon completion, a postdoc should have gained both depth and breadth in the geosciences and be well positioned to become a leading researcher, skilled scientist, and effective mentor.

## Open positions

**Wickert's** group works broadly on questions of river systems, sea level, glaciers, and paleoclimate. Our primary tools are continuum mechanics, computational analyses, instrumentation design, data synthesis, and field measurements. I am generally in search of students with strong mathematics/engineering/fluid mechanics backgrounds, though I do also bring in more traditional geologists/geographers.

Wickert's group is currently quite large, but he would consider applicants for projects in the general topics below. When reaching out about projects, it would be helpful to indicate which of the following topics interest you (and why, and what you might like to do in that direction), and if none do, then to suggest a different project. Due to the size of the group, there is a current need to keep some amount of focus (so advising support isn't spread thin among too many topics), but creative ideas are always appreciated. *With deep apologies: I cannot guarantee a response to requests to join the group that do not indicate that you have done background research into our research and goals or to how your future aspirations may align with these.*

**Larson** is considering prospective graduate students, particularly prospective M.S. students with strong backgrounds in Quaternary science, geomorphology/surface processes, and/or field geology. In addition, much of Larson's research is field and geospatial data focused so field work and GIS interests are necessary.  Larson has a number of research projects ongoing that potential graduate students focused on geomorphology/surface processes and interested in understanding drainage basin evolution and response tied to base level adjustment and drainage integration could fit in to.  Many of these projects are focused on landscapes in the upper Midwest, USA, where (de)glaciation and human impacts have produced a dynamic natural laboratory for rapid late Quaternary, post-Euro-American-settlement, and ongoing landscape change. Larson is also actively working in the Basin and Range and may have capacity for M.S. students interested in work there.  Larson is also receptive to inquiries with creative ideas/research questions in mind.  Just reach out.  Please make sure to include your C.V. and unofficial transcripts if you contact him.

## Important information for international students and visitors

Prospective international students and visitors to the University of Minnesota should be in touch with Andy Wickert and [International Student and Scholar Services](https://isss.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota.


## Important information for prospective students

### Key areas of expertise

My hope is for all students in the group to gain skills and confidence in all three major areas of our work
* Developing theory / numerical modeling / data-analysis techniques
* Laboratory research, whether in instrumentation design/development or at SAFL (hydraulics and sediments)
* Field work, which can range from local projects in river valleys to farther-flung work in remote locations and on glaciers

### Core course requirements and competencies

The University of Minnesota requires three pairs of core-science courses to ensure that our graduate-student entry requirements are equivalent to our undergraduate-student graduation requirements:
* 2 semesters of calculus (this means through the end of single-variable)
* 2 semesters of chemistry (this can sometimes be satisfied with geochemistry as one semester)
* 2 semesters of physics (typically, this is classical mechanics + E&M)
If you have not completed them, you may still apply but will have to complete these classes before you can graduate. Please be in touch if this is the case.

I expect that by the time they graduate, all of my students will exceed these levels of core competencies in mathematics and computation. Strong skills in differential equations, linear algebra, and programming (Python, C/C++, and possibly Fortran) will open a range of options for your future scientific career.

### Field work

*We welcome field scientists of all levels of physical ability.*

If you are interested in working in the field with us at a site that requires streuous backcountry travel, I expect that by the time of our departure, you will be able to carry a heavy load (35% of your body weight or greater) at a standard backpacker's pace (~1--2 miles per hour) over uneven terrain for multiple days. This is a requirement for both completion of the work and (most importantly) the safety of you and the group.

If your physical conditioning and/or a disability preclude this kind of work, we'd still like to see everyone who is interested join us in the field! We have some amazing and accessible field sites in Minnesota and Wisconsin wtih scientifically valuable and under-studied geomorphic histories and ongoing change. It is most important that students are comfortable with their research and in a good place to succeed.

### Personal learning and development objectives

**It is my goal that students in my group become confident, independent-minded, collaborative, and self-aware researchers.** This is a place to stretch your imagination and abilities. Sometimes there are funded projects with things that just need to be done, but as much as possible, I want to promote your ability to learn and explore.

Being supportive of you as a scientist means that I will also be (hopefully kindly) critical of your ideas and explanations. I want to make sure that you communicate clearly, ensure that your approaches are logically consistent, and verify that your work will be impactful. I typically help students early-on with some amount of coding, writing style and English-language usage (yes, even for native speakers), field skills, and geomorphic concepts. I expect that Ph.D. students will become much more independent and that our conversations become more high level later in your graduate career, and for you to be able to overcome appropriately greater challenges as your journey through your graduate career progresses. I expect similar independence and progress with M.S. students, but always have more rigidly defined projects in order to set students up for a 2-year path to graduation.
