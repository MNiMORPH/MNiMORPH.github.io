## Open positions

We are considering applicants for the following positions:

### Ph.D. student (University of Minnesota)

Working with both Phil Larson and Andy Wickert

* Deciphering the glacial and deglacial history upper Mississippi valley
  * Dating the terrace record (CRN and/or OSL)
  * Modeling river long-profile evolution
  * Linking to ice-sheet and proglacial lake history

### M.S. or Ph.D. student (University of Minnesota)

Working with Andy Wickert

* Environmental instrumentation
  * Designing, testing, and documenting sensors to measure water level
  * Possible extension to broader-scale weather and climate instrumentation
  * Focus will be on implementation: Bobby Schulz (current student) has completed or thoroughly started many hardware designs. This position therefore focuses on:
    * Field testing
    * Documentation
    * Telemetry
    * Bringing these technologies to the people who need them

### M.S. student (Minnesota State University, Mankato)

Working with Phil Larson

* Aeolian activity in the upper Mississippi valley
  * Identifying and dating (with OSL) ancient aeolian deposits
  * Bringing pulses of aeolian activity into a broad paleogeographic framework

### Undergraduate research assistant

Working with Andy Wickert

* Testing and documenting environmental instrumentation


## Important information for international students and visitors

Prospective international students and visitors should be in touch with Andy Wickert and [International Student and Scholar Services](https://isss.umn.edu/) at the University of Minnesota.


## Important information for prospective students

### Key areas of expertise

My hope is for all students in the group to gain skills and confidence in all three major areas of our work
* Developing theory / numerical modeling
* Laboratory research, whether in instrumentation design/development or at SAFL (hydraulics and sediments
* Field work, which can range from local projects in river valleys to farther-flung work in remote locations and on glaciers

### Core course requirements and competencies

The University of Minnesota requires three pairs of core-science courses to ensure that our graduate-student entry requirements are equivalent to our undergraduate-student graduation requirements:
* 2 semesters of calculus (this means through the end of single-variable)
* 2 semesters of chemistry (this can sometimes be satisfied with geochemistry as one semester)
* 2 semesters of physics (typically, this is classical mechanics + E&M)
If you have not completed them, you may still apply but will have to complete these classes before you can graduate. Please be in touch if this is the case.

I expect that by the time they graduate, all of my students will exceed these levels of core competencies in mathematics and computation. Strong skills in differential equations, linear algebra, and programming (Python, C/C++, and possibly Fortran) will open a range of options for your future scientific career.

### Field work

*We welcome field scientists of all levels of physical ability.*

If you are interested in working in the field with us at a site that requires streuous backcountry travel, I expect that by the time of our departure, you will be able to carry a heavy load at a standard backpacker's pace (~2 miles per hour) over uneven terrain for multiple days. This is a requirement for both completion of the work and (most importantly) the safety of you and the group.

If your physical conditioning and/or a disability preclude this kind of work, we welcome potential approaches involving less-strenuous local field work, remote sensing, and landscape analysis. It is most important that students are comfortable with their research and in a good place to succeed.

### Personal learning and development objectives

**It is my goal that students in my group become confident, independent-minded, collaborative, and self-aware researchers.** This is a place to stretch your imagination and abilities. Sometimes there are funded projects with things that just need to be done, but as much as possible, I want to promote your ability to learn and explore.
