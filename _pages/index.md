## Our Work and Goals

The surface-processes group at the University of Minnesota blends **field investigations**, **numerical modeling**, **geospatial analyses**, **laboratory experiments**, and **instrumentation design and fabrication** to address changes in past and present glaciers and ice sheets, river systems, sea level, and landscapes.

## UMN–MNSU collaboration

This website features intertwined and collaborative research groups and programs led by Andy Wickert in the Department of Earth & Environmental Sciences and the Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory at the University of Minnesota, and by Phillip Larson in the Earth Science Program, EARTH Systems Laboratory, and Department of Geography at Minnesota State University, Mankato.

In addition to these core semi-merged research groups, we maintain active collaborations with scientists across the region and around the world.

## Ethos

* Statement on importance of Earth-surface Science
* Statement on equity, diversity, and inclusion
