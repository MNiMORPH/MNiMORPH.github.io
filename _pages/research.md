  caption: "The upper Mississippi River integrated between 2.6 and 0.8 million years ago when ice first advanced into its catchment, damming rivers into lakes that overtopped ancient drainage divides and incised through isostatically uplifted landscape. Deeply eroded bedrock and an ancient waterfall beneath the river bed record the big river's dramatic start. *[Read the full study in Science Advances](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaav2366/).*"

## Rivers and lakes

### Incorporating topographic depressions into drainage analyses

Internally-drained regions in digital elevation models, termed "depressions", have been traditionally treated as artifacts that need to be removed. While sometimes this was the case, many depressions are real. Unfortunately, these algorithms that erased depressions forced hydrologic and geomorphic models to also ignore them. This technological deficiency fueled a paradigm in which hydrologists and geomorphologists focused on steep mountain catchments rather than low-relief catchments with lakes and swales.

The Depression Hierarchy and Fill-Spill-Merge algorithms and associated code bases (https://github.com/r-barnes/Barnes2019-DepressionHierarchy; https://github.com/r-barnes/Barnes2020-FillSpillMerge) are poised to reverse this trend. They allow us to integrate closed depressions directly into drainage networks in a mathematically consistent way as part of a directed graph. This tool will allow models to incorporate more elements of reality and open new landscapes and environments to cutting-edge hydrological and geomorphic research.

## Glacial cycles and global change

How did ice sheets and global sea-level change since the Last Glacial Maximum, ~26,000â€“19,500 years ago, and what can this teach us about past and modern landscapes, ice dynamics, climate, and glacial-isostatic adjustment?
