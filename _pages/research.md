  caption: "The upper Mississippi River integrated between 2.6 and 0.8 million years ago when ice first advanced into its catchment, damming rivers into lakes that overtopped ancient drainage divides and incised through isostatically uplifted landscape. Deeply eroded bedrock and an ancient waterfall beneath the river bed record the big river's dramatic start. *[Read the full study in Science Advances](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/1/eaav2366/).*"

## Glacial cycles and global change

How did ice sheets and global sea-level change since the Last Glacial Maximum, ~26,000â€“19,500 years ago, and what can this teach us about past and modern landscapes, ice dynamics, climate, and glacial-isostatic adjustment?
